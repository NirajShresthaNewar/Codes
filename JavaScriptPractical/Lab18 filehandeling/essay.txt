**Database Security Issues**

Database security is paramount in today's digital world. Here are some of the most common database security issues:

* Unauthorized access: This occurs when someone gains access to a database without proper authorization.
* Data breaches: A data breach is a security incident that results in the unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive data.
* SQL injection attacks: SQL injection attacks are a type of web application vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into a database query.
* Malicious software (malware): Malware, such as viruses and worms, can infect databases and steal or corrupt data.
* Human error: Human error is a significant factor in database security breaches.
